title: "Adaptive Control Design and Stability Analysis of RR Robotic Manipulators"
excerpt: "This paper presents the adaptive control design and stability analysis of robotic manipulators based on two approaches: Lyapunov stability theory and hyperstability theory. We introduce two types of control for a 2-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) robotic manipulator: computed-torque control and adaptive control. Additionally, we apply adaptive control to end-effector motion and force control, emphasizing motion control (e.g., position control, trajectory tracking). The control system developed by integrating Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control and Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) demonstrates convergence through the hyperstability approach. We compare the characteristics of the systems developed using PID control, MRAC control, and hybrid (PID + MRAC) control.<br/><img src='/images/acs_motion_control.png'>"
