title: "MIMO System Identification of A Quadcopter"
excerpt: "The Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) system of a quadcopter is more complex than a simple Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) system, necessitating a scientific analysis. After tuning a stable PID controller, we found that the ARX model best fits the experimental data. Our system identification approach enables the design of a stabilizing controller that improves the quadcopter's performance.<br/><img src='/images/drone_arx_model.png'>"

This is my final project in the class of System Identification in Spring 2022. 
Please refer to my [presentation slide](http://twwang97.github.io/files/report_sysID_David.pdf) for more details.
