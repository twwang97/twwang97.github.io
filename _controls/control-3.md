title: "μ-Synthesis Design of A Half-Car Active Suspension System"
excerpt: "This project develops control strategies for vibration reduction in the suspension system to enhance passenger comfort. The challenge arises from disturbances originating from various sources. To achieve robust performance, we design a stabilizing controller to manage the actuators, improving both ride comfort and suspension deflections. This work focuses on an active suspension system and μ-synthesis, resulting in robust performance through our controller design.<br/><img src='/images/mu_synthesis_model.png'>"
