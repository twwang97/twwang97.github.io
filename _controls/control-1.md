title: "Vibration Suppression of An Optical Table"
excerpt: "A decoupling method called disturbance response decoupling (DRD) is introduced to reduce the vibration of an optical table. The DRD is extended to Output DRD and Input-Output DRD to enhance the optical table performance under varied simulation conditions.<br/><img src='/images/iodrd_diagram.png'>"
