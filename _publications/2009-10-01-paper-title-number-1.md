* Abstract

	* Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) is critical in robotics, computer vision, and environmental reconstruction. This paper presents an improved GPU-accelerated Red, Green, Blue-Depth (RGB-D) module for real-time SLAM. Our approach utilizes parallel computing on GPUs to enhance depth measurement quality with a bilateral filter and minimize CPU-GPU data transfer overhead. Experimental results on the TUM RGB-D dataset demonstrate accurate camera pose estimation, dense surfel-based mapping, and three outputs: camera pose, sparse map (Atlas), and dense map (mesh). Our GPU implementation enables efficient deployment in resource-constrained environments, offering improved 3D reconstruction and real-time performance for various RGB-D SLAM applications. By leveraging the parallel computing capabilities of GPUs, our system contributes to the advancement of real-time RGB-D SLAM, providing new possibilities for robotics and autonomous systems.

* Keywords: RGB-D SLAM, 3D Reconstruction, GPU Acceleration, ORB-SLAM3, Surfel-Based Mapping
