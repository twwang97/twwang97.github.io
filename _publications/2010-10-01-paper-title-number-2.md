My Contributions: 
* Conducted two-dimensional (2D) LiDAR SLAM and presented <b>modified GMapping</b> that addresses loop-closing.
* Developed a real-time three-dimensional (3D) <b>mesh reconstruction</b> pipeline from <b>RGB-D</b> data. 
* Developed different pathfinding algorithms on navigation mesh (<b>NavMesh</b>) and implemented the path replanning mechanism. 
* Integrated 3D mesh, pathfinding, and <b>obstacle avoidance</b> into our autonomous 3D navigation system
