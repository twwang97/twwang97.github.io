Hello — I’m Tsung-Wun (David) Wang. I recently completed 230 hours in the [Electronics and AI Training Program (3rd Session, 2025)](https://base.stem.lasercenter.nycu.edu.tw/storage/backend/courses/1316076bd92678b7402924bc4cf21a6a.pdf) launched by the Ministry of Labor, Taiwan. There I deepened my electronics knowledge and gained hands‑on experience working with components in the Microelectronics Lab.

Previously, I worked as an engineer at Vecow, focusing on software and embedded-systems development. My work included sensor fusion, autonomous mobile robot (AMR) systems, Python automation, and FPGA projects such as the VTS and VE1008 series, where I developed gPTP synchronization and multi‑camera streaming solutions. For a full breakdown of my responsibilities and results, please see my [resume](http://twwang97.github.io/files/resume_TsungWun.pdf).

This site showcases my resume, professional and research projects, and published papers. Browse to see examples of my engineering and robotics work, including project overviews, technical highlights, and downloadable artifacts. Thank you for visiting — I look forward to connecting and exploring opportunities to collaborate.
