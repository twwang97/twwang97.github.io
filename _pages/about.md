Hello, I'm Tsung-Wun (David) Wang, a recent graduate with a Master of Science degree in mechanical engineering from National Taiwan University. I successfully defended my [thesis](https://twwang97.github.io/files/thesis_abstract.pdf) on July 26, 2023, and I'm thrilled to share my academic and research journey with you.

During my studies, I delved deep into the realm of mechanical engineering, with a particular focus on areas such as <b>SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)</b>, <b>computer vision</b>, <b>motion planning</b>, and <b>navigation for mobile robots</b>. My academic pursuits have led me to explore innovative solutions to complex engineering challenges.

In addition to my academic endeavors, I have practical experience gained during an internship at a drone company. This experience includes <b>sensor fusion</b>, where I worked with various sensors and applied advanced filtering techniques for estimating orientation, altitude, and position. For more details on this experience, please refer to my [resume](http://twwang97.github.io/files/professional_standard_resume_0915.pdf).
