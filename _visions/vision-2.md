For the final project of the class of 3D Computer Vision with Deep Learning Applications, our team proposed "<b>SAD-SLAM: Sign-Agnostic Dynamic Simultaneous Localization and Mapping</b>". This project aims to optimize mapping and tracking, and remove dynamic objects. It improves the performance of mapping and tracking in NICE SLAM using Sign-Agnostic optimization. Dynamic objects removal is implemented in NICE SLAM using Mask R-CNN and background inpainting. The results are validated on some datasets and experiments. More details could be found on [Github](https://github.com/MartyJan/SAD-SLAM).
