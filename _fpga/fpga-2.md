- Project 1: FSM-based RCA/CLA with Magnitude Comparators
  * [GitHub](https://github.com/twwang97/altera-de2-115.git), [Report](http://twwang97.github.io/files/report_verilog_adder.pdf), [YouTube](https://youtu.be/tccfjy2j27w)
  * Designed and implemented ripple-carry adder (RCA) and carry-lookahead adder (CLA) in VHDL/Verilog and synthesized with Quartus.
  * Verified FSM-based designs using ModelSim testbenches covering directed and corner-case stimuli.
  * Integrated 8-bit comparators with a 7‑segment display and demonstrated real‑time operation on DE2‑115.

- Project 2: Simulation of Phase Detector (LTspice and ModelSim)
  * This [report](http://twwang97.github.io/files/report_phase_detector_nycu_1126.pdf) analyzes different types of phase detectors and PLLs and simulate in both LTspice and ModelSim software.
