* [GitHub](https://github.com/twwang97/altera-de2-115.git), [Report](http://twwang97.github.io/files/report_verilog_adder.pdf), [YouTube](https://youtu.be/tccfjy2j27w)
* Designed and implemented RCA and CLA in VHDL/Verilog and synthesized with Quartus.
* Verified FSM-based designs using ModelSim testbenches covering directed and corner-case stimuli.
* Integrated 8-bit comparators with a 7‑segment display and demonstrated real‑time operation on DE2‑115.
