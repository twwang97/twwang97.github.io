We developed some VHDL in Vivado and architected a Vitis pipeline to program our Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC for deterministic multi‑camera streaming. This [report](http://twwang97.github.io/files/report_vecow_ve1008_simple.pdf) demonstrated the multi‑camera streaming and added a block RAM for data verification.
