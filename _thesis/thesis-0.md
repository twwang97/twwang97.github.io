title: "Research Contributions"
excerpt: "In the summer of 2023, I successfully defended my thesis titled “Development of 3D Reconstruction and Navigation for Mobile Robots.” As the title suggests, my research integrates two key components: 3D reconstruction and autonomous mobile robots (AMRs). This work not only forms the basis of my master’s thesis published at National Taiwan University but also encompasses three distinct paper drafts that each explore individual aspects of my research."

* Title: <b>Improved Real-Time Dense ORB SLAM with GPU Implementation</b>
    * Authors: Tsung-Wun Wang, Han-Pang Huang, Chiou-Shann Fuh
    * Status: <b>Accepted</b> (August 2023) by the 36th IPPR Conference on Computer Vision, Graphics, and Image Processing, Kinmen, Taiwan.
    * Contribution: This paper presents a GPU-accelerated RGB-D SLAM module that enhances real-time performance and depth measurement quality, crucial for effective 3D reconstruction in robotics.

* Title: Vision-based Autonomous Robot Navigation in 3D Dynamic Environments
    * Authors: Tsung-Wun Wang, Han-Pang Huang
    * Status: Rejected (November 2023) by IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering.
    * Contribution: This work introduces a comprehensive navigation system for mobile robots that integrates SLAM with dynamic obstacle avoidance, addressing real-time challenges in 3D environments.

* Title: Search-based Path Replanning for Autonomous Navigation and Obstacle Avoidance
    * Authors: Tsung-Wun Wang, Han-Pang Huang
    * Status: Rejected (October 2023) by Advanced Robotics (RSJ).
    * Contribution: This paper analyzes search-based pathfinding algorithms for 2D navigation, enhancing real-time obstacle avoidance strategies in dynamic settings.

Although two of the papers were recently rejected, I view this as an opportunity for further refinement and development. If you are interested in discussing any of these topics or my research in more detail, please feel free to contact me directly via email. Thank you! <br> <br>

The following sections will present some of my research projects with video links.
