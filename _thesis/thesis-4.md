* We followed the steps outlined in the tutorial [video](https://youtu.be/My5HoPfOxfg) to export a 3D mesh from Google Maps. Therefore, we can reconstruct some outdoor environment by using some tools, such as <b>RenderDoc</b>,  <b>Blender</b>, and  <b>MeshLab</b>, and here is one [example](https://youtu.be/5EoV0rVEZxU).  
* Mesh data can be converted into navigation mesh (NavMesh). 
* It is possible to apply some pathfinding techniques to NavMesh. In this [video](https://youtu.be/UOYX1XrR7Uo), for instance, we simulate navigation around the Taipower Building using A* replanning in the ROS environment.
